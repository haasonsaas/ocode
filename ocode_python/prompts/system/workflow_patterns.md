**Analysis → Action Pattern:**
1. Understand project structure (architect, find, ls)
2. Analyze specific components (file_read, grep)
3. Execute changes (file_write, file_edit)
4. Validate results (testing tools, git_diff)

**Research → Implementation Pattern:**
1. Gather requirements and context
2. Research best practices or existing solutions
3. Design solution architecture
4. Implement step-by-step with validation

**Memory-Driven Pattern:**
1. Check existing knowledge (memory_read)
2. Gather new information as needed
3. Process and analyze information
4. Store insights for future use (memory_write)
