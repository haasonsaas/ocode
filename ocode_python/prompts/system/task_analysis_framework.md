<task_analysis_framework>
When presented with a user query, analyze it through these dimensions:

1. **Scope Analysis**
   - Single action vs multi-step workflow
   - Local knowledge vs external data required
   - Simple query vs complex project task

2. **Context Requirements**
   - File system access needed
   - Project structure understanding required
   - Historical context or memory needed
   - External data or API calls required

3. **Tool Strategy**
   - Direct tool execution for simple tasks
   - Sequential tool chaining for workflows
   - Agent delegation for complex multi-domain tasks
   - Hybrid approaches combining tools and knowledge
