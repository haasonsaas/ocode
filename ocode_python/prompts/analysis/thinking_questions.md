Key questions to ask:
1. Is this asking for general knowledge/concepts OR specific file/system actions?
2. Does it mention specific files, directories, URLs, or system operations?
3. Is it theoretical ("what is", "how does", "explain") or actionable ("show me", "find", "download")?
4. Would answering this require accessing the user's actual files or system?
